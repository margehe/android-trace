Interactive trace processor shell.
Usage: ./trace_processor_shell [OPTIONS] trace_file.pb

Options:
 -h, --help                           Prints this guide.
 -v, --version                        Prints the version of trace processor.
 -d, --debug                          Enable virtual table debugging.
 -W, --wide                           Prints interactive output with double
                                      column width.
 -p, --perf-file FILE                 Writes the time taken to ingest the trace                         // 把检查trace文件耗时和查询trace文件耗时写到给定的文件中
                                      and execute the queries to the given file.
                                      Only valid with -q or --run-metrics and
                                      the file will only be written if the
                                      execution is successful.
 -q, --query-file FILE                Read and execute an SQL query from a file.
                                      If used with --run-metrics, the query is
                                      executed after the selected metrics and
                                      the metrics output is suppressed.
 -D, --httpd                          Enables the HTTP RPC server.
 --http-port PORT                     Specify what port to run HTTP RPC server.
 -i, --interactive                    Starts interactive mode even after a query
                                      file is specified with -q or
                                      --run-metrics.
 -e, --export FILE                    Export the contents of trace processor
                                      into an SQLite database after running any
                                      metrics or queries specified.
 -m, --metatrace FILE                 Enables metatracing of trace processor
                                      writing the resulting trace into FILE.
 --metatrace-buffer-capacity N        Sets metatrace event buffer to capture
                                      last N events.
 --metatrace-categories CATEGORIES    A comma-separated list of metatrace
                                      categories to enable.
 --full-sort                          Forces the trace processor into performing
                                      a full sort ignoring any windowing
                                      logic.
 --no-ftrace-raw                      Prevents ingestion of typed ftrace events
                                      into the raw table. This significantly
                                      reduces the memory usage of trace
                                      processor when loading traces containing
                                      ftrace events.
 --analyze-trace-proto-content        Enables trace proto content analysis in
                                      trace processor.
 --crop-track-events                  Ignores track event outside of the
                                      range of interest in trace processor.
 --dev                                Enables features which are reserved for
                                      local development use only and
                                      *should not* be enabled on production
                                      builds. The features behind this flag can
                                      break at any time without any warning.

Standard library:
 --add-sql-module MODULE_PATH         Files from the directory will be treated
                                      as a new SQL module and can be used for
                                      IMPORT. The name of the directory is the
                                      module name.
 --override-sql-module MODULE_PATH    Will override trace processor module with
                                      passed contents. The outer directory will
                                      specify the module name. Only allowed when
                                      --dev is specified.
 --override-stdlib=[path_to_stdlib]   Will override trace_processor/stdlib with
                                      passed contents. The outer directory will
                                      be ignored. Only allowed when --dev is
                                      specified.

Metrics:
 --run-metrics x,y,z                  Runs a comma separated list of metrics and
                                      prints the result as a TraceMetrics proto
                                      to stdout. The specified can either be
                                      in-built metrics or SQL/proto files of
                                      extension metrics.
 --pre-metrics FILE                   Read and execute an SQL query from a file.
                                      This query is executed before the selected
                                      metrics and can't output any results.
 --metrics-output=[binary|text|json]  Allows the output of --run-metrics to be
                                      specified in either proto binary, proto
                                      text format or JSON format (default: proto
                                      text).
 --metric-extension DISK_PATH@VIRTUAL_PATH
                                      Loads metric proto and sql files from
                                      DISK_PATH/protos and DISK_PATH/sql
                                      respectively, and mounts them onto
                                      VIRTUAL_PATH.
